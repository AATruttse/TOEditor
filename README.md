# TOEditor

TOEditor is an open-source, cross-platform tool for creating, editing, and visualizing military organizational-staff structures (TO&E). It allows users to build libraries of formations (e.g., squads, platoons, battalions), view them as editable tables or diagrams, and export to files or spreadsheets.

## Features (Planned)
- Create and manage libraries (e.g., "US ARMY 2003") with parameters like country, period, tags.
- Build hierarchical formations with personnel, equipment, and positions.
- View/edit as tables or customizable diagrams (NATO/RF symbols, colors, icons).
- Aggregate summaries (total personnel, equipment).
- Export/import to JSON/YAML files, XLSX, PNG/SVG.
- Version control for formations and libraries.
- Multi-language support (English/Russian initially).
- Web site integration for sharing libraries.

## Tech Stack
- Rust for core logic.
- Slint for declarative GUI.
- SQLite for internal DB.
- Serde for JSON/YAML serialization.
- Open-source under MIT license.
